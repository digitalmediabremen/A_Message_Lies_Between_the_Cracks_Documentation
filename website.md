An imagined divination system based on cracks on cooked rice

Rice, a fundamental sustenance in many cultures, holds deep connections to ceremonies, rituals, and divinations. As automated machines dominate the growing, processing, and cooking of rice, the involvement of digital technology prompts one to wonder about the emergence of new forms of rice divination.

When cooked, the force of heat and water naturally forms cracks on the surface of rice grains. To gain a better understanding of the potential patterns of these cracks, five hundred grains of rice are cooked, dried, and photographed under a digital camera with a microscope lens, creating a comprehensive collection of crack patterns.

*The dataset of 500 grains of cooked rice grains*

 From this dataset, a divination system is crafted, based on visual analysis of various crack patterns using computer vision techniques. Similar patterns can be identified by the algorithm and mapped to a pre-defined category. Every category has a metaphorical name as a binding point between the visuals and the text. During each divination, a short message based on pre-written text is generated according to the category of the crack pattern.
